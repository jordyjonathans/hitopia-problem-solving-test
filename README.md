## Question 1  :  
In the first question, we have to solve the weighted strings problem. So, in this question we have to determine if some alphabets given have correct weight or not.
The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the *inputString*. All operations inside the loop run in constant time, and the loop itself runs n times.

here is the answer of question number 1:

## Question 2 :
In the second question, we have to solve the balanced bracket problem. So, in this question we have to determine if the bracket pattern is valid or not.
The time complexity of this code is O(n). The *solveBalancedBracket* function is called recursively until *ctr* reaches the length of *arrInputBrackets*. This means that the function is called once for each element in *arrInputBrackets*.

here is the answer of question number 2:

##Question 3:
In the third question, we have to solve the highest palindrome problem where we have to replace some numbers with the limit which determined by *K* variable to fix the number series to be correct palindrome pattern.
The time complexity of this code is O(n/2), because the recursive is only performed half of n times, that is n/2 times.
